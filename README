== Lightroom Lua Shell ==

Lightroom Lua Shell presents a command-line interface in Adobe Lightroom, as an aid in plugin development, or a as quick low-level way to make metadata changes on photos.

To install, click File -> Plug-In Manager -> Add, and pick this directory.

To use, click Library -> Plug-In Extras -> Lua shell. The Lightroom plugin API does not appear to provide a way to make scrollable dialogs, so you may find new command results appearing below the bottom of the output view. To clear the view, just type "clear()".

Besides clear(), other pre-loaded extras provided in the shell environment include:
 - catalog => LrApplication.activeCatalog()
 - target = LrApplication.activeCatalog():getTargetPhoto()
 - targets = LrApplication.activeCatalog():getTargetPhotos()
Of course, you can still call import() just as you would inside a plugin.

Note that commands that would normally need to be called asynchronously (within an LrTask) are silently wrapped, so that:
x = target:getRawMetadata('fileSize')
becomes:
LrTasks.startAsyncTask(function() x = target:getRawMetadata('fileSize')) end)
Note that in the result window, normal return values are prefixed by "->", while asynchronous return values are prefixed by "=>".
